Installation
------------

First you need to make sure you have [Alfred2](http://www.alfredapp.com/) with [Powerpack](http://www.alfredapp.com/powerpack/).

Then you need to install [RPD](http://rpd.lynnard.tk) and [RPC]. Follow the installation guideline for both programs.

After that you can download the binary version of this extension using this [link](https://github.com/lynnard/RPD-Alfred/raw/master/RPD.alfredworkflow) or if you're a developer you can clone this repo and play around with the files to your heart's content.

Set a keyboard shortcut inside the workflow editor window if you feel like that.
